## Article classification project.

Project that tries to classify newspaper articles between two categories:

- "Γυναικοκτονία" (Feminicide)
- "Ανθρωποκτονία" (Homicide)

Articles are scraped from online versions of Greek newspapers ([Efsyn](https://www.efsyn.gr), [Lifo](https://www.lifo.gr) and [Newsit](https://www.newsit.gr)). A sincere thanks to these news outlets.

Currently there has been a debate on the term "Γυναικοκτονία" (Feminicide) as more and more murders of women are making the news. This project tries to create an meta-search analysis which tries to distinguish between the two terms.

This project was inspired by:

> D’Ignazio, Catherine, et al. Feminicide & Machine Learning : Detecting Gender-Based Violence to Strengthen Civil Sector Activism. 2020, http://www.kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DIgnazio-et-al.-2020-Feminicide-Machine-Learning-Detecting-Gender-ba.pdf.
