## Article classification project.

Project that tries to analyse newspaper articles on selected subjects.

Articles are scraped from online versions of Greek newspapers ([Efsyn](https://www.efsyn.gr), [Lifo](https://www.lifo.gr) and [Newsit](https://www.newsit.gr)). A sincere thanks to these news outlets.

## Project set up:

`cd` yourself to the reqs folder and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

This should help you install all the available dependencies for this project. 

Info on how to create `requirements.txt` for a jupyter-notebook found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-a-requirements-file-jupyter-notebook-385f1c315b52).
